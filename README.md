The HR Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of an organization’s workforce, focusing on employee attrition, demographics, and satisfaction trends. Developed using Power BI, it transforms raw HR data into interactive visuals that reveal key insights such as total employees, attrition count, attrition rate, active employees, and average age.
